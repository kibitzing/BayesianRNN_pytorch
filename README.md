# bayesianLSTM_pytorch
pytorch implementation of [bayesian LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287)

Extension of [pytorch implementation of RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK REGULARIZATION](https://github.com/ahmetumutdurmus/zaremba).  
Many codes are from repository above.

Many of hyperparameters are from [the repository of the author of the paper (Yarin Gal)](https://github.com/yaringal/BayesianRNN).
